            <div class="bottom_margin"><h3>Hypothesis:</h3>Spatially situated digital navigation experiences can be used as a means of expressing hopeful speculative fiction narratives, informing social action. And these embodied stories can center divergent, diverse, queer and racialized voices in the context of rising technological warfare at a global scale, historical trajectories of traditional fabric weaving, creative computing, and resistance.</div>

            <div class="bottom_margin"><h3>Art-research statement:</h3>Speculative fiction, at its core, is a vision of a potential future informed and imagined by present realities – what does this fundamental genre characteristic look like in our current day research, creation, or writing output? With a transmedia landscape shattered into pieces formed by automated information, user-created content and multi-institutional control over communication technologies, traditional narratives about the future of technology use cases and the relationship between consumers and creators must be remodeled, reshaped, and, in some ways, terraformed in order to establish a more meaningful speculative vision of our present and future technologically tinged lives through interactive fiction.<br><br>With this proposed research-creation project, we aim to build a collection of interactive navigational physical and digital prototypes that simulate, explore, or introduce our game/art collective’s ethos of a commitment to expanding and equalizing access to digital media art creation while conceptualizing, developing, and building stories that matter to us and our diverse communities in as many different ways (mediums/academic streams/art styles/workflows) as we possibly can.<br><br>We are advocates for the power of multi-linear storytelling and feel strongly about the idea that one of the most impactful ways we as queer, diverse, and divergent creatives can remain visible in spaces where we seldom have the opportunity to take control of dominant narratives is through our ability to craft our own, on our terms.<br><br>These fundamental elements form the basis of the ideation on this proposed project: a highly interactive multimedia installation bringing to the forefront ideas about technological warfare, historical through lines of fabric weaving, design interface simulation, and a potential inclusion of a drone flight experience with theatrical flair. If we are to acknowledge the scattered and multilayered nature of mediatic experiences today, this project is an experiment in attempting to build our own topographical map of narrative nonlinearity that pervades our experiences as users, creators, designers, and storytellers.</div>

            <div class="bottom_margin"><h3>Significance & context:</h3>Now more than ever, digital media arts have the capacity to bridge the gap between creators who are the decision-makers when it comes to technology and consumers who endure its consequences. While the prevalent emerging technology seems to favor making profit over a caring cultivation of humanity --along with the planet and its inhabitants-- several activists are deciding to turn towards low-fi tech instead of opposing technology as a whole. Tools that have been created to be exploitative, extractive and destructive are hacked into, and taken back by the people, for the people.<br><br>As an indigenous, native means of resistance, traditional art practices, as well as communications technology and creative computing, rise to the challenge of fighting back against capitalist colonial projects. Within the whirlwind of a world plagued by local examples of injustice. For instance, just north of Montreal, in Ile Sainte Therese, people are being evicted from the houses built by their great grandparents half a century ago, in order to make space for a public park that will supposedly make their experience on the island more enjoyable. Entire ecosystems are taken away to be replaced by artificial ones and manicured lawns.<br><br>We need to recognize shared struggle as a basis for solidarity, and acknowledge the traces of violence in sanitized built environments. And, that the technological software-hardware tools we create play an important role in fostering freedom of movement, and thought, against increasingly regimented traversal of the social and literal landscape. In other words; our navigational directives, in the digital and physical realms, have to change and become more fluid to resist the dominant paradigm of military information control.</div>

            <div class="bottom_margin"><h3>Project description:</h3>The final project will be a collection of playable prototypes through which the player can interact with their surroundings via a variety of navigable interfaces. The narrative of the experience is gleamed through speculative fiction components in complementary formats to the interactions.</div>

            <div class="bottom_margin"><h3>Interactive navigation interfaces:</h3><i>History tracer:</i> A navigable branching timeline tracing the history of weaving, fabrics and computing for networked technology, contrasted against the development of robotics, AI, and drones in war. Presented as a web interface, accessed through a browser.<br><br><i>Embroidery circuit designer:</i> A digital simulation of cross-stitch pattern design on a grid, that emulates the flow of electricity through conductive thread. Presented as a web interface or executable application. A speculative fabulation component hints at the purpose of the design interface in a fictional narrative context.<br><br><i>FPV drone flight:</i> Participants are guided to operate a consumer-grade FPV drone for indoor flight,  by traversing a designated path in the exhibition space. The experience is wrapped in a theatrical narrative context.<br><br><i>Security camera viewport array:</i> A localized interface showing the video feed of cameras placed in the exhibition space, or showing video footage of per-recorded staged events. The interface simulates a desktop work space with fictional documents providing narrative context.<br><br><i>WaterStrider nav-droid:</i> A 3D navigable environment with 3rd person game-like controls, that allow players to explore the sea in a cybernetic buoyant vessel. This WaterStrider robot can lift off into the air to fly above the waves or glide over the surface of the water. A speculative narrative audio component hints at the purpose and inner workings of the drone/droid.</div>
